// USE FAKE INFO FOR THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE

// Initialize a variable called CreditCardNum, set it equal to a fake credit card string-number
// Initialize a variable called last4SS, set it equal to a 4 string-numbers (dont use your real SS last 4!)
// Initialize a variable called userId, set it equal to a fake user ID
// Initialize a variable called password, set it equal to a fake password

// Create two last variables called inputId & inputPass, initially set them as the same values as userId and password


// Write a ternary statement that checks if userId is equal to inputId and if password is also equal to inputPass
// If they are the same, log the credit card num and the last4SS
// If not, log 'incorrect username or id'





// Utilize the switch statement to re-write your horse-racing exercise from earlier
// Feel free to copy the old if statement in and convert it into a switch statement
